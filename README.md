# Investment Growth Calculator

This project is an investment growth calculator in C++. The program allows users to input an initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years. It then calculates and displays the investment growth with and without monthly deposits over the specified number of years.

## Project Summary and Problem Solved
The Investment Growth Calculator provides users with the clear and ~accurate~ differences of the growth of an investment over time with and without monthly investments. 

## Strengths
- Clear and modular code structure with functions separated into respective files.
- Input validation to ensure valid user inputs.
- Formatting of output for better readability.
- Utilization of C++ features such as classes, member functions, and stream manipulation.

## Potential Enhancements
- Implement additional error handling.
- Provide additional options for different interest calculation methods.
- Enhance the user interface with a menu-driven system or graphical user interface (GUI).

## Challenges and Learning Resources
One of the most challenging aspects of this project was formatting the output table correctly, particularly when handling different numbers of years and months. To overcome this, had to scour StackOverflow to learn C++ string manipulation and formatting techniques.

## Transferable Skills
This project reinforced my skills in problem-solving, code organization, and data formatting. This experience will be valuable for future C++ projects and other object-oriented programming endeavors.

## Code Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

- Consistent coding style and naming conventions.
- Clear and concise comments throughout the code.
- Separating the code into logical modules and files.
- Descriptive variable and function names.

By following these practices, the codebase becomes more accessible for future modifications, enhancements, or adaptations to meet evolving requirements.
